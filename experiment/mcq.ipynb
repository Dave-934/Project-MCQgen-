Per the wishes of the two Zenos, the Grand Minister announced that the eight universes with the lowest fighter levels would be required to compete. The Universes that did not win the competition would immediately be erased from existence by the two Omni-Kings, resulting in the loss of more than half of the multiverse. To the shock of all present, it was declared that even the Gods of Destruction and Supreme Kais of the defeated Universes would be erased as well. The only ones spared from erasure in a defeated universe would be the attendants to the Gods of Destruction. Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 were exempt from participating in the tournament due to their inhabitants having an average Mortal Level above 7. The eight other Universes, such as Universe 7 (level 3.18) or Universe 9 (level 1.86), are left to fight to determine which one of them deserves to be saved.\n",

      "Originally, the majority of the participants blamed Goku for endangering the Universes' existence by putting the idea for the tournament into Zeno's head. However, it was eventually revealed that Zeno always intended to destroy the Universes, and the tournament was the last minute change to allow one Universe to be spared.\n",

Like the Tournament of Destroyers, the Super Dragon Balls were announced as the prize for the winner of the tournament. The tournament arena was designed by the Great Priest and forged from an alloy known as Kachi Katchin. In the anime, prior to the start of the tournament, three of the Gods of Destruction, Iwan, Arak, Liquiir, battled one another in order to test the stage's durability while Giin opted out of fighting stating that the result would be obvious. These three gods were later required to repair the damage their battle inflicted upon the arena, as well as see to any design flaws made apparent in the Grand Minister's original design.\n",

Unlike the World Martial Arts Tournament, the Tournament of Power is a survival-style battle royale in which all 80 fighters face each other simultaneously and must knock their opponents off of the ring to defeat them. Warriors who are rendered unconscious are still considered active competitors until they are removed from the stage. The warriors who get knocked off the stage are immediately teleported to the spectator bench to observe the remainder of the competition along with the gods of their respective Universe. The use of weapons and killing are prohibited during the match and the ability of Flight is disabled (though participants with wings or possess non-ki-based flight abilities are not prohibited from doing so). A new rule prohibiting the use of healing items was announced right before the tournament started.

      "{'text': \"The Tournament of Power was originally conceived by Zeno after witnessing the Tournament of Destroyers held by Beerus and Champa. After enjoying the tournament for its entertainment value and the spectacle of the participating fighters, Zeno determined that a larger competition involving all of the Universes would prove even more entertaining.\\n\\nLater, after meeting the Future Zeno, Zeno had more or less forgotten about the tournament until reminded by an eager Goku. Having not seen the original martial arts competition, the Future Zeno was uncertain of the idea, leading to the need for the Zeno Expo, a smaller demonstration of a fighting competition.\\n\\nIt was at the Zeno Expo where the stakes of the Tournament of Power were set forth. Per the wishes of the two Zenos, the Grand Minister announced that the eight universes with the lowest fighter levels would be required to compete. The Universes that did not win the competition would immediately be erased from existence by the two Omni-Kings, resulting in the loss of more than half of the multiverse. To the shock of all present, it was declared that even the Gods of Destruction and Supreme Kais of the defeated Universes would be erased as well. The only ones spared from erasure in a defeated universe would be the attendants to the Gods of Destruction. Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 were exempt from participating in the tournament due to their inhabitants having an average Mortal Level above 7. The eight other Universes, such as Universe 7 (level 3.18) or Universe 9 (level 1.86), are left to fight to determine which one of them deserves to be saved.\\n\\nOriginally, the majority of the participants blamed Goku for endangering the Universes' existence by putting the idea for the tournament into Zeno's head. However, it was eventually revealed that Zeno always intended to destroy the Universes, and the tournament was the last minute change to allow one Universe to be spared.\\n\\nFollowing the Zeno Expo, the eight participating universes were given approximately forty-eight hours to select and gather ten fighters each to compete whilst the Grand Priest built the tournament fighting stage.\\n\\nThe tournament occurred in the Null Realm, an isolated place outside of the twelve universes with literally no time or space, allowing the participants to use the fullest extent of their powers. Like the Tournament of Destroyers, the Super Dragon Balls were announced as the prize for the winner of the tournament. The tournament arena was designed by the Great Priest and forged from an alloy known as Kachi Katchin. In the anime, prior to the start of the tournament, three of the Gods of Destruction, Iwan, Arak, Liquiir, battled one another in order to test the stage's durability while Giin opted out of fighting stating that the result would be obvious. These three gods were later required to repair the damage their battle inflicted upon the arena, as well as see to any design flaws made apparent in the Grand Minister's original design.\\n\\nEach team in the tournament consists of ten warriors from each of the eight participating universes, adding up to a total of 80 fighters. Unlike the World Martial Arts Tournament, the Tournament of Power is a survival-style battle royale in which all 80 fighters face each other simultaneously and must knock their opponents off of the ring to defeat them. Warriors who are rendered unconscious are still considered active competitors until they are removed from the stage. The warriors who get knocked off the stage are immediately teleported to the spectator bench to observe the remainder of the competition along with the gods of their respective Universe. The use of weapons and killing are prohibited during the match and the ability of Flight is disabled (though participants with wings or possess non-ki-based flight abilities are not prohibited from doing so). A new rule prohibiting the use of healing items was announced right before the tournament started. The match will last 100 takks (approx. 48 minutes on Earth) and the Universe with the most survivors, or sole survivor if there is one, will be the winner.\\n\\nIn the anime, according to the Grand Minister at the conclusion of the Tournament of Power, Zeno has foreseen the outcome of the tournament, and had decided that the wish that was made by the winner would signify if the remaining universe deserved to survive. In this way, if the winner made a selfish wish, all universes would be erased, and if a selfless wish was made by a virtuous being as Zeno predicted, any wish would be allowed and the victors would not be erased.\\n\\nRules.\", 'number': 5, 'subject': 'biology', 'tone': 'Medium', 'response_json': '{\"1\": {\"Q1\": \"Multiple Choice Question\", \"Options\": {\"a\": \"choose this\", \"b\": \"choose this\", \"c\": \"choose this\", \"d\": \"choose this\"}, \"Correct\": \"Correct Answer\"}, \"2\": {\"Q2\": \"Multiple Choice Question\", \"Options\": {\"a\": \"choose this\", \"b\": \"choose this\", \"c\": \"choose this\", \"d\": \"choose this\"}, \"Correct\": \"Correct Answer\"}, \"3\": {\"Q3\": \"Multiple Choice Question\", \"Options\": {\"a\": \"choose this\", \"b\": \"choose this\", \"c\": \"choose this\", \"d\": \"choose this\"}, \"Correct\": \"Correct Answer\"}}', 'difficult': 'Medium', 'quiz': 'Here are 5 medium-level MCQs based on the provided text:\\n\\n{\\n\"1\": {\\n\"Q1\": \"Who conceived the idea of the Tournament of Power?\",\\n\"Options\": {\\n\"a\": \"Beerlus and Champa\",\\n\"b\": \"Zeno\",\\n\"c\": \"Grand Minister\",\\n\"d\": \"Future Zeno\"\\n},\\n\"Correct\": \"b\"\\n},\\n\\n\"2\": {\\n\"Q2\": \"What was the original purpose of the Tournament of Power?\",\\n\"Options\": {\\n\"a\": \"To determine the strongest fighter in the multiverse\",\\n\"b\": \"To entertain the Omni-Kings\",\\n\"c\": \"To erase the weakest universes\",\\n\"d\": \"To reward the strongest warriors\"\\n},\\n\"Correct\": \"b\"\\n},\\n\\n\"3\": {\\n\"Q3\": \"What were the stakes of the Tournament of Power?\",\\n\"Options\": {\\n\"a\": \"The winning universe would gain more power\",\\n\"b\": \"The losing universes would be erased\",\\n\"c\": \"The tournament would be cancelled\",\\n\"d\": \"The gods of destruction would be erased\"\\n},\\n\"Correct\": \"b\"\\n},\\n\\n\"4\": {\\n\"Q4\": \"What was the format of the Tournament of Power?\",\\n\"Options\": {\\n\"a\": \"A one-on-one elimination tournament\",\\n\"b\": \"A survival-style battle royale\",\\n\"c\": \"A team-based competition\",\\n\"d\": \"A time-trial competition\"\\n},\\n\"Correct\": \"b\"\\n},\\n\\n\"5\": {\\n\"Q5\": \"What was the purpose of the Zeno Expo?\",\\n\"Options\": {\\n\"a\": \"To demonstrate the tournament format\",\\n\"b\": \"To announce the tournament rules\",\\n\"c\": \"To test the arena\\'s durability\",\\n\"d\": \"To introduce the Omni-Kings\"\\n},\\n\"Correct\": \"a\"\\n}', 'review': 'Complexity Analysis:\\nThe quiz is moderately challenging, with a mix of factual and analytical questions.
